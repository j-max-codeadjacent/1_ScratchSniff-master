			<p class="about-text" >The prose of Marcel Proust, 20th-century French modernist, transports his reader down Swann's Way through his words' mastery of sensation.  Early and often, his poignent descriptions of scent engage an instant transportation into the minds of his characters.  Dr. Virginia Barry, psychiatrist and psychoanalyst, investigates the neurobiological architecture behind Proust's techniques.  In a fanciful twist on In Remembrance of Time Past, Dr. Barry provides a set of scratch and sniff scents and scientific discussions to illustrate the direct neural connection between scent and memory. Together with the stunning mural work of Chicago artist Heather Hancock, Dr. Barry opens up a fresh and exciting new way to interpret Proust's masterpiece.</p>

			<h2 class="about-header">About the Author</h2>
			<p class="about-text"> Virginia Barry is a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst in full-time private practice in Chicago. She has been  on the Faculty of the Chicago Institute for Psychoanalysis  since 1991 and has taught many clinical and theoretical courses to psychoanalytic candidates. For more than a decade she has taught a course entitled “Mind & Brain” that introduces candidates to  areas of neuroscience and cognitive science that have relevance for clinical and theoretical psychoanalysis. She is especially interested in thinking about the biology of meaning, the development of language from gesture, the isomorphism between the  hierarchical organization of the brain and  that of the mind, and the alterations of agency and motivation during the course of a psychoanalysis.  Dr. Barry lives in Evanston, Illinois with her two Bengal cats. She is the mother of two grown children, one a neuroscientist and the other a poet. In her spare time she writes fiction.

			<h2 class="about-header">About the Artist</h2>
			<p class="about-text"> 

		Heather Hancock creates visual experiences with glass.<br>
		<br>
		Heather balances art with science in her Evanston studio. The conceptual foundation for her work comes from a decade-long career in healthcare as a speech pathologist and then as program director for the Department of Physical Rehabilitation and Medicine, University of Chicago at Weiss Hospital. A Mosaics Master Class in Venice, Italy provided the technical basis for her work. Heather uses this ancient medium as a conceptual tool to explore how people engage with information in the natural, manmade and social environments. Glass comes to life with motion and light. Viewers passing by glass mosaics become participants in interaction with a series of moments that illuminate a space.<br>
		<br>
		Heather was born in Alberta, Canada and relocated to the Chicago area in 1993. She currently resides in Evanston with her husband and their two children. Whether skating at the lakefront pond, biking Chicago area trails or hiking the Rockies, Heather and her family can be found out-of-doors every chance they get.

			<h2 class="about-header">Neuroscience of Smell</h2>
			<p class="about-text">Marcel Proust’s novel explores the power of sensations to elicit emotional memories. Olfaction, the process of smelling the scents in our world, can transport us to other times in our lives through the long-lasting associations we have to odors, fragrances and smells. The ability to smell – to detect chemical gradients in the environment – is present in organisms with limited or no nervous systems such as even the lowly yeast cell. This rudimentary system of sensing the world has been elaborated throughout evolution and supports how our noses work today. Because smell detection is so vital to our survival, the smell system is paradoxically our most “primitive” and our most evolved sensory system. The linkages the neuronal pathways from the nose to the brain help us understand the emotional power of smell. </p>
