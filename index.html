			<h2 class="about-header">About Scratch and Sniff Proust</h2>
			<p class="about-text" >The prose of Marcel Proust, 20th-century French modernist, transports his reader down Swann's Way through his words' mastery of sensation.  Early and often, his poignent descriptions of scent engage an instant transportation into the minds of his characters.  Dr. Virginia Barry, psychiatrist and psychoanalyst, investigates the neurobiological architecture behind Proust's techniques.  In a fanciful twist on In Remembrance of Time Past, Dr. Barry provides a set of scratch and sniff scents and scientific discussions to illustrate the direct neural connection between scent and memory. Together with the stunning mural work of Chicago artist Heather Hancock, Dr. Barry opens up a fresh and exciting new way to interpret Proust's masterpiece.</p>

			<h2 class="about-header">About the Author</h2>
			<p class="about-text"> Dr. Virginia Barry is a psychoanalyst in private practice in Chicago, Illinois.  For over two decades, she has been engaged in studying the interface between neuroscience and psychoanalytic models of the mind.  Dr. Barry skillfully combines the words of Proust-psychology-art-prose-science and medicine to reveal the link between smell and emotion. A link we knew was there but did not understand …<br>
			<br>

			Author Dr. Barry writes: <br>
			<br>
			Memories elicited by smell are imbued with a kind of visceral and  emotional essence that sets them apart from memories called up by words or images alone. I am transported when I bury my nose in a bunch of freshly cut basil; whereas seeing a recipe for Insalata Caprese generates a grocery list. Another parched day of drought makes me wish for rain, but the smell of the earth-the petrichor-after that first rain makes me want to dance and fills me with optimism. The memories evoked by fragrances are rarely bland or colorless; they are drenched in emotion.<br>
			<br>
			Although he didn’t have neuroscience to illuminate why olfaction is so emotionally evocative, Marcel Proust understood the power of scent to unleash ancient, long forgotten memories that form the foundation of our emotional lives. As the title of his great work tells us, In Search of Lost Time (also translated from the French as The Remembrance of Things Past) is concerned with these memories and the stamp they place on the experience of the present. Scratch and Sniff Proust began as a wisp of a joke and has evolved into something much more-part neuroscience, part art, part psychoanalysis.<br>
			<br>
			A consistent compositional structure was developed for the glass art to connect with both literal objects referred to in each target quotation and the larger conceptual themes of the constructive nature of memory, the role of language in accessing memory and the neuroscience of signaling and transmission. Literal imagery is captured in gestural, instagram-style photographs. Each literal image has an associated scent.

			Dr. Barry writes:<br>
			<br>

			I chose Heather as a collaborator given her integration of her visual art practice with a background in applied neurosciences. Her work with glass is about visual experience; she explores the many properties of glass to infuse spaces with meaning and interest, offering viewers a moment soon gone, yet filled with radiance. This approach is consistent with Proust’s extensive contemplation about light and shadow, reflections and contrasts. Heather’s art pieces offer visual interpretations for each section of the book, forming another connection with Proust’s inner world.</p>
